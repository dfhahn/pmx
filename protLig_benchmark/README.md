## Folder structure: ##
   ### For every protein-ligand dataset ###
	- ligands_gaff2: for every ligand two topology files are present. 
	ffMOL.itp contains the atomtypes, the rest of topology parameters are in MOL.itp. 
	Structure is in the mol_gmx.pdb file. Force field: Gaff v2.1
	
	- ligands_cgenff: topology and structure for cgenff. 
	CGenFF v3.0.1 with the atom typing based on MATCH was used for most of the ligands, 
	except for Bace inhibitors, where paramchem.org web-server was used in combination with CGenFF v4.1.
	
	- protein_amber: structure and topology for protein and, 
	if available, co-crystallized waters and ions. Force field: amber99sb*ILDN
	
	- protein_charmm: structure and topology for Charmm36m force field
	
	- transformations_gaff2: edge information and hybrid structures/topologies for gaff.
	
	- transformations_cgenff: edge information for cgenff. 
	
  ddg_data: the folder contains calculated ddG values for all the protein-ligand datasets
